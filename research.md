In some form or other, I often think about the following number of questions at the moment:

1. What are the limits of what can meaningfully be said, and is there anything beyond those limits that is nevertheless somehow available to us (e.g. certain forms of understanding)?
2. What is our position in the world, and how are we to understand this position? (In particular, are we forced to accept or repudiate some form of idealism?)
3. What, if anything, characterises human agency both as distinctively human and as distinctively active?
4. What is the import of the tradition of moral perfectionism for radical political thought and social critique?

With every one of these questions, I also think a great deal about how we should think about the question itself: how, if at all, are we to understand it and its central terms â€” what is its meaning and import, what sort of answer are we looking for in responding to it, and how are we to approach the business of finding such an answer and what would count as a satisfying or right answer? In short, I think a great deal about how to do philosophy in the first place; and about what, if anything, characterises philosophical questions and answers as such.

I am currently working on three essays:

1. An essay about the marks of agency.
2. An essay on ineffability and different kinds of understanding.
3. An essay about philosophical originality.
