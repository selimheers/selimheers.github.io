<p>For my thesis I am thinking about how certain ideas and questions usually associated with the label 'skepticism' are related to ideas and questions usually associated with the label 'idealism'. In trying to articulate my views of these issues I take as my point of departure the writings of Stanley Cavell. Other points of orientation are the writings of Wittgenstein and Anscombe as well as Kant and Hegel.</p>

<p>Apart from that, I think about action and perception a lot. In the future, I hope to be able to bring to bear on my academic work my interests in radical political thought and its connections to what Cavell calls moral perfectionism.</p>
