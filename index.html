<p>I am a PhD student in philosophy at the University of Leipzig. My main supervisor is Adrian Haddock.
  From 2020 I did a Master's degree in philosophy at the University of Oxford. Before that, I completed a BA in philosophy and general & comparative literature at the University of Zurich.
  Even earlier, I completed a BA in economics, also at the University of Zurich.</p>
